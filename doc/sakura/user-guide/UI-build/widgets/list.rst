List
====

"Display list of inventory items selected by the provided filter"
Allow to display a list according to a set of defined mongo filters.
Filters use a field name (from event specification) a condition and a value.
For example a filer like the following: `state is equal 2` would show a list of all events where a given component or resource state is critical.
