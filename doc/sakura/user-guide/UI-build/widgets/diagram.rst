=======

Compare values in a pie or a categorized bar graph.
Diagrams widgets are different from Line and bar graphs width in that they only display one value (the last one) per metrics at a given time. Diagram are useful to compare few metrics between themselves. The Figure 1 below shows the delta of resources usage on a given host for a specified time frame. We can see disk, memory and swap usage for a delta of 15mn and a time interval of a day.
