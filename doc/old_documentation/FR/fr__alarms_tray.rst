.. _FR__Alarms_Tray__Desc:

Description
-----------

Alarms Tray **MUST** replace the current Events Tray in Canopsis, thanks to new
Alerts engine, that handles events diffently.

The general purpose of Alarms Tray is to display alarms in an html table.

Columns title
-------------

Alarm columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each alarm **MUST** have its own informations splited in multiple columns.

All informations contained in an :ref:`FR::Alarm <FR__Alarm>` **MUST** be
displayable in a column :

 - uid
 - connector
 - connector name
 - component
 - resource
 - entity id
 - state
 - status
 - snooze conditions
 - ack conditions
 - cancelation conditions
 - ticket declaration
 - output (message)
 - open date
 - solved date

There are 2 exceptions :

 - extra : extra is a set of custom fields. Each field in this set **MUST**
   have its own displayable column.
 - steps : :ref:`FR::Alarm <FR__Alarm>` steps are not supposed to be rendered
   in a table column. It **CAN** be exploited by the timeline widget, but this
   feature is out of the scope of this document.

Aggregated columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some informations are not stored in an alarm document but **MUST** be
displayable in their own columns :

 - linklist
 - pbehaviours

Those informations are related to an `entity_id` rather than an :ref:`FR::Alarm
<FR__Alarm>` itself.

Columns display
---------------

The display of each column listed above **MUST** be configurable :

 - Each column **CAN** be displayed or not
 - Each column **MUST** render data with a specific renderer. This rendered
   **CAN** be configurable (particularly useful for
   :ref:`FR::Alarm <FR__Alarm>` extra fields).

Filtering
---------

Custom filters **CAN** be applied to select alarms that have to be displayed or
not.

Those filters are mongo filters. A user just need to copy a column title to
name keys in his filter. Those keys **MUST** be translated to match the
underlying data model.

The following columns can *not* be filtered because it would cost too much
to aggregate all values :

 - linklist
 - pbehaviours

Dates
~~~~~

Due to UI live reporting behaviour, filtering alarms by period is not
achieved the same way as described above.

Alarms concerned by a date interval are alarms that have been opened, were
opened or have been closed in this interval.

Searching
---------

Users **MUST** be able to perform quick searches thanks to a text bar.

If the expression contains only alphanumerical characters (+ eventual spaces,
underscores, minuses), this expression **MUST** be searched on a list of
configurable fields.

Users **CAN** also perform advanced searches with a simple DSL.

Search DSL
~~~~~~~~~~

This DSL **MUST** allow the following conditional expressions :

 - ``FIELD = VALUE`` (and ``!=``, ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, ``>=``, ``CONTAINS``,
   ``LIKE`` operators)
 - ``NOT FIELD CONTAINS VALUE`` (comparison negation)
 - ``FIELD < VALUE AND FIELD2 REGEX VALUE2`` (and ``OR`` condition operator)
 - ``ALL F1 = V1`` (meta-parameter changing search behaviour)

Those quick searches **MUST** apply a filter on the subset of alarms returned
by the permanent `filter` by default. Quick searches **CAN** apply a filter on
all alarms (ignoring current `filter`) if the expression is prefixed by
``ALL``.

UI **SHOULD** warn users whose search expressions are not *grammatically*
correct.

**Note:** Expressions with parenthesis are not supported.

Columns sorting
---------------

Each column title **CAN** be clicked to toggle sorting :

 - The first click **MUST** sort raws with a DESC filter on this field
 - The second click **MUST** sort raws with an ASC filter on this field
 - The third click **MUST** clear any sorting on this field

This behaviour implies that sorting can be done only for *one field at a
time*.

Pagination
----------

Results **MUST** be paginated. Alarms tray **MUST** show at any time :

 - first and last indexes of displayed alarms
 - number of alarms in total
 - optionally whether or not total number has been truncated

Those values **MUST** take in account filters, searches and date intervals.

**Note:** For performance reasons, the number of alarms in total can be
approximated or truncated.
