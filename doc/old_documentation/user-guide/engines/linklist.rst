Linklist
========

Overview
---------

The link list feature aims to associate links to Canopsis entities. This is done by different following ways:

 - Canopsis receives an event that contains a specific key such as **action_url** that may be equal to **http://canopsis.org**
 - A Canopsis user defines relations between Canopsis entities and some urls that have to be associated to them.

In the end, the final user will be able to see a list of link associated to a specific event as shown in the picture below:

Rights
------

The linklist feature comes with a right management system. Link list actions are enabled if the user is allowed for the ``actionbutton_canediturlfield`` right. This right allow to schedule a new linklist computation task and to create a rule for link list computation.


How to associate links
----------------------

Link association can be done into the link list view, witch is reachable from the engine menu.

Once in the link list configuration view, click ``create`` button.

In the form, select entities that have to be associated to the link list that you have to fill below by editing a filter.
A link is made of a **label** and an **url**.

Once done, link list are ready to be computed. The only left action to perform is to trigger a link association computation thanks to the scheduled job system. for more information about the job system go to `scheduled jobs <scheduledjobs.html>`_
