==============

.. note::
   Don't forget to look at :ref:`user-ui-userviews` Section



Creating / Removing a View
--------------------------

To create a view, just use the "add view" button located here :

And fill in the form

You can add ``tag`` to help you order views in other forms like in ``view management``

or in ``default view`` editor

Containers and Widgets
----------------------

The next step is to put some widgets on a view.

In most of case, you will first have to include :ref:`user-ui-widgets` into :ref:`containers <user-ui-widgets-containers>`

Don't forget to add options to widgets with the Canopsis :ref:`user-ui-mixins` feature
