Common problems
===============

General purpose
---------------


**client/server date synchronisation**

When a client uses the canopsis UI which is loaded from the server, it is strongly advised to check if the client computer and the remote server date system are synchronized. Missynchronization may lead to unexpeted behaviors such as timewindow bad interpretation in widget rendering as timewindow are generated from the UI and compared on the server for exemple when issuing some metric data queries.

MongoDB won't start
-------------------

You need to verify the following:

 * at least 4GB free on your *Canopsis* partition
 * no other service are listening on port 27017

RabbitMQ won't start
--------------------

Sometimes, *RabbitMQ* fails to stop properly, a child process remains : ``beam.smp``.
Check if it exists by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   # su - canopsis
   $ ps ux | grep beam.smp
   if a process is found
   $ kill -9 <found pid>

Then try to restart *RabbitMQ*.

Another problem that can occur is wrong permissions on the *Erlang* cookie.
Check that you have the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   # su - canopsis
   $ ls -l .erlang.cookie
   -r-------- 1 canopsis canopsis 20 june  10 00:00 .erlang.cookie

If not, correct the permissions, and try to restart *RabbitMQ*.

No events found
---------------

When no events are found by *Canopsis UI*, the root cause can be:

 * an exception occurred in the engines chain:
    * check the logs in ``var/log/engines`` to verify
    * if an error is found, report it with the traceback
 * an engine failed to start, and events are stacking up in the queue:
    * check if the engine is listed in ``etc/supervisord.d/amqp2engines.conf``
    * check the engines status with: ``service amqp2engines status``
    * look into the logs to determine why it didn't start
    * report the error if found
 * the engines chain is mis-configured:
    * verify that the file ``etc/amqp2engines.conf`` chain the event to the ``eventstore``
 * the event isn't received at all:
    * using ``amqp2tty``, verify that the event is listed after its emission

Python project won't install
----------------------------

This means there is an error in the *Canopsis* Python package.
The ``setup.py`` will import ``canopsis.<project>`` in order to fetch the package's
version.

If there is an error in this module, the ``setup.py`` will fail with an ambiguous error.

Since the Python projects are installed **after** the Python libs, you can try this:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd sources/python
   $ PYTHONPATH="$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH" /opt/canopsis/bin/python
   >>> from canopsis import <project>
   the real error should be printed here
