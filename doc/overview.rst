What is Canopsis ?
------------------


`Canopsis <http://canopsis.org>`_ is an open-source `hypervisor <http://www.capensis.fr/solutions/hypervision/>`_ whose goal is to :doc:`aggregate/consolidate <consolidation>` information and events (containing :doc:`metrics <metrics>` of different types such as performance, availability, etc.) coming from multiple sources to create a global solution for :doc:`monitoring <Dashboard>` and :doc:`administrating <engines>` resources.

Built to last on top of `proven Open Source technologies by and for all IT professionals <http://www.capensis.fr/solutions/supervision/>`_.
