Common problems
===============

No datas retreived
------------------

Look at rabbitmq's logs in ``var/log/rabbitmq/rabbit@<hostname>.log`` for any connection problems.

* Did you changed machine's name after Canopsis installation?

If yes, then modify ``etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-env.conf`` this way:

.. code-block:: bash

    NODENAME=rabbit@<old hostname>

The hostname is used by RabbitMQ to store datas (mnesia database, logsâ€¦), if you change it, be sure to modify this variable.

Now you can restart canopsis:

.. code-block:: bash

    su - canopsis
    hypstart canopsis restart
