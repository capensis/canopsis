# Statistics API

## Specification

#### URL

This API defines two routes :

 - `POST /api/v2/stats/<stat name>`: to compute the value of the statistic
   `<stat_name>`.
 - `POST /api/v2/stats`: to compute the value of multiple statistics.

#### Parameters

These routes take a JSON object with the following fields:

 - `stats` (only for `/api/v2/stats`, required) : a list containing the names
   of the statistics to compute.
 - `tstart` (optional) : a timestamp indicating the start of the interval.
 - `tstop` (optional) : a timestamp indicating the end of the interval.
 - `group_by` (optional) : a list of tags.
 - `filter` (optional) : a list of *entity groups*. The entities that are part
   of at least one of the groups will be taken into account when computing the
   statistics.
 - `parameters` (optional) : an object containing parameters for the
   statistics. For the `/api/v2/stats` route, the parameters for a statistic
   should be in `parameters.<stat_name>`.

An *entity group* is a JSON object containing `"<tag name>" : <tag filter>`
couples. An entity is part of this group if each of its tags validates the
corresponding filter.

The tag name can be used to filter according to :

 - The entity's identity, with the names `entity_id` and `entity_type`.
 - One of the entity's informations, with the names
   `entity_infos.<information_id>`. Only the information ids specified in the
   [statsng engine configuration](../../../admin_guide/statsng.md#entity-tags)
   can be used in filters.
 - The alarm, with the names `connector`, `connector_name`, `component`,
   `resource` and `alarm_state`.

The tag filter can be :

 - a string, a tag validates this filter if its value is equal to this string.
 - a list of strings, a tag validates this filter if its value is in this list.
 - an object `{"matches": "<regex>"}`, with `<regex>` a [regular
   expression](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/), a tag validates this
   filter if its value is matched by this regular expression.

```javascript
[ // Compute statistics for entities belonging to at least one of the following groups
    { // This group contains the entities whose tags validate the following conditions
        "<tag1>": "value",                   // tag1's value is "value" ET
        "<tag2>": ["value1", "value2", ...], // tag2's value is in [...] ET
        "<tag3>": {"matches": "value\d+"}    // tag3's value is matched by the regex
    },
    // ...
]
```

#### Response

The response is a JSON array containing objects with :

 - a `tags` field, whose value is an object containing the values of the tags
   specified in `group_by` (or an empty object if `group_by` is not defined).
 - one field for each statistic that was requested.


## Statistics

### Number of alarms created

The statistic `alarms_created` is equal to the number of alarms created
during a time interval.

### Number of alarms resolved

The statistic `alarms_resolved` is equal to the number of alarms resolved
during a time interval.

### Number of alarms canceled

The statistic `alarms_canceled` is equal to the number of alarms canceled
during a time interval.

### Mean ack time

The statistic `mean_ack_time` is equal to average time taken for an alarm to
be acknowledged.

### Mean resolve time

The statistic `mean_resolve_time` is equal to average time taken for an alarm
to be resolved.

### Ack time above or below the SLA

The statistic `ack_time_sla` is a JSON object with the following fields:

 - `above`: the number of alarms whose ack time is above the SLA.
 - `below`: the number of alarms whose ack time is below the SLA.
 - `above_rate`: the ratio of alarms whose ack time is above the SLA (between 0
   and 1).
 - `below_rate`: the ratio of alarms whose ack time is below the SLA (between 0
   and 1).

The value of the SLA should be provided in seconds in the parameter `sla`.

### Resolve time above or below the SLA

The statistic `resolve_time_sla` is a JSON object with the following fields:

 - `above`: the number of alarms whose resolve time is above the SLA.
 - `below`: the number of alarms whose resolve time is below the SLA.
 - `above_rate`: the ratio of alarms whose resolve time is above the SLA
   (between 0 and 1).
 - `below_rate`: the ratio of alarms whose resolve time is below the SLA
   (between 0 and 1).

The value of the SLA should be provided in seconds in the parameter `sla`.

### Time spent in each state

The statistic `time_in_state` is a JSON object with :

 - one field for each state (between 0 and 3), containing the time spent by the
   entity in this state, in seconds
 - a `total` field, containing the total time

The intervals during which a pbehavior is active are excluded from these
values. The total time may thus be inferior to the duration of the interval
`tstop - tstart`.

### Availability

The statistic `availability` is a JSON object with the followign fields:

 - `available_time`: the time during which the entity was in an available
   state, in seconds
 - `unavailable_time`: the time during which the entity was in an unavailable
   state, in seconds
 - `available_rate`: the ratio of time during which the entity was in an
   available state (between 0 and 1)
 - `unavailable_rate`: the ratio of time during which the entity was in an
   unavailable state (between 0 and 1)

The entity is considered to be available if it is in a state lower or equal to
the value of the parameter `available_state`.

The intervals during which a pbehavior is active are excluded from these
values. The total time `available_time + unavailable_time` may thus be inferior
to the duration of the interval `tstop - tstart`.
