Line graph
==========

"Display perfdata on customizable graphs."
Line graphs are roughly the same widgets as the Bar graphs. They are both used to display an historic of data for a given component or resource. Choosing between the two is just a matter of preferences for curves instead of bars and few other render options that are specific to each other. Functionality wise they are the same.
