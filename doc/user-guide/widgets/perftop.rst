Perftop
=======

"Display list of metrics sorted by value"
Perf. Top is typically used to display the "mosts / lesses" cases. The most used disks, the most used cpus, or inversely the less used disks and cpus. For doing so it uses a customisable mongodb filter as shown in figure 1 below. The filter used here is: `metric is equal used` (see Canopsis Build menu > perfdata for a list of all available metrics)
