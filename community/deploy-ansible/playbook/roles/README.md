# deploy-ansible/playbook/roles

Everything inside this directory is either:

* our own creation (the `canopsis` and `postgresql-timescaledb` roles);
* or an upstream role which has been heavily forked and modified to suit our needs (`rabbitmq`, `redis`, `mongodb`).

Each role maintains its original licence.
