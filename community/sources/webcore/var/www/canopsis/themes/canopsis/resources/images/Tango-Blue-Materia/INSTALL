Tango Materia Icon Theme
---------------------------

Just unpack the iconset to ~/.icons or /usr/share/icons

note: "~" means is your home directory, i.e.: /home/<YOU>/.icons

OR
Easier way is to use GNOME Theme Preferences:

Go to Main Menu > System > Preferences > Theme 

Choose 'Install Theme', locate the tarball and let GNOME do the
installation process.
