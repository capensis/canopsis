1. What is the Tango Desktop Project?
The Tango Desktop Project exists to create a consistent user experience 
for free and Open Source software with graphical user interfaces. 

While the look and feel of an application is determined by many components 
the initial work has been done on unifying the look of the individual icon sets.

Tango defines a standard icon style guidelines document that applications and 
desktop enviroments can adhere to. Work has started on creating a new base icon
theme based on a standard icon naming specification. In addition, we provide 
transition utilities to create icon themes for existing GNOME and KDE desktops.
