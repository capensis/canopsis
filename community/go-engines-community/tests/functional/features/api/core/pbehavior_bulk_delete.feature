Feature: Bulk delete pbehaviors
  I need to be able to bulk delete pbehaviors
  Only admin should be able to bulk delete pbehaviors

  Scenario: given bulk delete request and no auth pbehavior should not allow access
    When I do DELETE /api/v4/bulk/pbehaviors
    Then the response code should be 401

  Scenario: given bulk delete request and auth pbehavior by api key without permissions should not allow access
    When I am noperms
    When I do DELETE /api/v4/bulk/pbehaviors
    Then the response code should be 403

  Scenario: given bulk delete request should return multi status and should be handled independently
    When I am admin
    When I do DELETE /api/v4/bulk/pbehaviors:
    """json
    [
      {
        "_id": "test-pbehavior-to-bulk-delete-1"
      },
      {
        "_id": "test-pbehavior-to-bulk-delete-not-found"
      },
      {},
      {
        "_id": "test-pbehavior-to-bulk-delete-2"
      }
    ]
    """
    Then the response code should be 207
    Then the response body should contain:
    """json
    [
      {
        "id": "test-pbehavior-to-bulk-delete-1",
        "status": 200,

      }
    ]
    """
    When I do GET /api/v4/pbehaviors/test-pbehavior-to-bulk-delete-1
