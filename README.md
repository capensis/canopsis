## What is Canopsis ? 

[Canopsis](http://canopsis.org) is an open-source [hypervisor](http://www.capensis.fr/solutions/hypervision/) whose goal is to [[aggregate/consolidate|consolidation]] information and events (containing [[metrics]] of different types such as performance, availability, etc.) coming from multiple sources to create a global solution for [[monitoring|Dashboard]] and [[administrating|engines]] resources.

Built to last on top of [proven Open Source technologies by and for all IT professionals](http://www.capensis.fr/solutions/supervision/). It is an event based architecture and it is modular by design. Plug your infrastructure tools like `Syslog`, `Nagios`, [`Shinken`](https://github.com/naparuba/shinken), `...` to [Canopsis](http://canopsis.org) and you're ready to go.

A [[Glossary]] page is also given for better descriptions about canopsis concepts.
