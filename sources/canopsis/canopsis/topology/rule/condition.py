"""Module in charge of defining main topological rule conditions.

A topological vertice doesn't require a condition.

In addition to this condition, it is possible to test another condition which
refers to source nodes if they exist.

Such conditions are::

    - ``new_state``: test if state (or event state) is not equal to node state
    - ``at_least``: test if source node states match with an input state.
    - ``_all``: test if all source node states match with an input state.
    - ``nok``: test if source node states are not OK.

The ``new_state`` condition may be used by nodes bound to entities in order to
update such nodes when the entity change of state.

Related rule actions are defined in ``canopsis.topology.rule.action`` module.
