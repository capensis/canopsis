Environment setup
============================
If you need change environment for nightwatch you can do it in the `tests/e2e/.env.local`

For example: If you are receiving the problem with `chromedriver` version, you can set `CHROME_DRIVER_PATH`.
```
# Example for yarn global package
CHROME_DRIVER_PATH=/usr/local/share/.config/yarn/global/node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/chromedriver
```


Folder structure conventions
============================
We have the following project structure:
```
e2e
├── custom-assertions        # Folder with assertions
│   └── elementCount.js      # Special global assertion
├── custom-commands          # Folder with commands
│   ├── completed            # Folder with completed commands. Completed ui action. For example: login, logout and etc.
│   │   └── login.js         # Completed ui command
│   └── customClick.js       # Global command
├── helpers                  # Folder with helpers
│   └── sel.js               # Special helper for something
├── page-objects             # Folder with page objects (https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/#working-with-page-objects)
│   └── admin                # Folder for unioning of admin pages page-objects
│       └── users.js         # Page-object for /admin/users page
├── records                  # Folder with nightwatch-record unsuccessful tests records
├── reports                  # Folder with nightwatch xml reports
├── specs                    # Folder with tests
│   └── 01-auth              # Folder with several tests file. If we want to order files we can put number prefix.
│       └── auth.js          # File with tests. If we want to order files we can put number prefix here.
├── globals.js               # Global nightwatch methods, properties and etc. (http://nightwatchjs.org/guide#external-globals)
├── nightwatch.config.js     # File with settings for nightwatch (http://nightwatchjs.org/gettingstarted#settings-file)
```

Page Object API
===============
We are using page object api for every pages (https://nightwatchjs.org/guide/#working-with-page-objects).

in the page object we should implement the following moments:

* `url` address of the page. It can be function or property
* `commands` with every user actions: Click on something, setSomething into input, verify something before/after and etc.
* Every `elements` which we need: submitButton, usernameField, view button and etc. Here we have several moments:
    * If we can't identify UI element by existing attributes (class, id, special attribute and etc.) we can put `data-test` attribute for the element in the our application and use it. This attribute will remove from code on the production environment.
    * If we have dynamic element identify (for example: href attribute with view id or something else) we can put `el` helper and use it in the page object instance. Example in `page-objects/layout.js`
* We can split page to `sections` and put it if we want.

Custom command/assertion convention
===================================
We will consider `custom-commands` folder but this we must apply and on `custom-assertions`

* We should put command into global `custom-commands` folder if we need it more than on one test/page-object.
* If we can move this command into page-object and use it in several tests we must do it.
* If our global command it is the simple user action (like: `click`, `setValue` and etc.) we should move it just into `custom-commands` folder. But if our command completed user action (like: `login`, `logout`) we should put it into `custom-commands/completed` folder.

Tests writing convention
========================
If we need set the order of tests running we can put number prefixes for tests files. But it will be better if we will write tests isolated (So that the tests do not depend on each other).
