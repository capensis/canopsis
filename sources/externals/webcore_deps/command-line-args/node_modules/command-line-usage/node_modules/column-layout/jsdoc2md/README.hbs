# column-layout
Pretty-print text data in columns.

## Synopsis
Say you have some data:
```json
[
    {
      "column 1": "The Kingdom of Scotland was a state in north-west Europe traditionally said to have been founded in 843, which joined with the Kingdom of England to form a unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Its territories expanded and shrank, but it came to occupy the northern third of the island of Great Britain, sharing a land border to the south with the Kingdom of England. ",
      "column 2": "Operation Barbarossa (German: Unternehmen Barbarossa) was the code name for Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union during World War II, which began on 22 June 1941. Over the course of the operation, about four million soldiers of the Axis powers invaded Soviet Russia along a 2,900 kilometer front, the largest invasion force in the history of warfare. In addition to troops, the Germans employed some 600,000 motor vehicles and between 600–700,000 horses."
    }
]
```

pipe it through `column-layout`:
```sh
$ cat example/two-columns.json | column-layout
```

to get this:
```

Columns containing wrappable data are auto-sized by default to fit the available space. You can set specific widths using `--width`

```sh
$ cat example/two-columns.json | column-layout --width "column 2: 55"
