  What is this?
  -------------

  Timeline is a DHTML-based AJAXy timeline.


  Running Timeline
  ----------------

  Timeline consists of static resources, Javascript libraries,
  image files and css files. All you really need is to
  serve those resources off a web server. Any web server will do.

  Two ways to access the library
  
  1. Unzip either timeline_source.zip or timeline_libraries.zip into
     a directory served by a webserver.
     
     timeline_source.zip includes complete source and example files. Use your
     browser to see the examples at
     .../timeline_directory/src/webapp
     
     timeline_libraries.zip is the minimum install of the bundled js libraries,
     css and image files
     
  2. No web server? The timeline project includes a small webserver called
     Jetty (use the timeline_source.zip file)
     a) install the Java runtime from Sun
     b) unzip timeline_source.zip to an install directory
     c) Open a shell or command prompt to the install directory and type:
  
     [win32]> run
     [unix/macosx]> chmod +x run; ./run

     and then point your browser to
  
     http://127.0.0.1:9999/timeline/
