"""Module in charge of defining topology processing in engines.

When an event occured, the related entity is retrieved and all bound
topological nodes are retrieved as well in order to execute theirs rules.

First, a topology processing is triggered when an event occured.

From this event, bound topology nodes are retrieved in order to apply node
    rules.

A typical topological task condition is an ``canopsis.task.condition.all``
composed of the ``canopsis.topology.rule.condition.new_state`` condition and
``canopsis.topology.rule.action.change_state`` action.
If this condition is checked, then other specific conditions can be applied
such as those defined in the canopsis.topology.rule.action module.
